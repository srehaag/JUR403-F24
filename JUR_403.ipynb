Young\\nCountry: Iraq\\nRPD Number: TC2-10041\\nAssociated RPD Number(s): N/A\\nATIP Number: A-2022-01960\\nATIP Pages: N/A\\nDECISION\\n[1] MEMBER: So I have had a chance to consider the evidence. I am prepared to render a decision in this matter orally. This will be \\u2014 this decision will be sent to you following our hearing and may be edited for spelling and grammar purposes.\\n[2] This is a decision in the claim for refugee protection by XXXX XXXX XXXX file number TC2-10041. You are claiming to be a citizen of Iraq and you are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\\n[3] So my determination is based on all the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities you face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Kurdish Iraq based upon your political opinion, which you have been critical of the administration and operation of the XXXX system in the XXXX province.\\n[4] In summary, the allegations in this matter as follows. You describe your fear of persecution originates from the tragic passing of your wife from COVID in a XXXX hospital in the spring of 2021. You describe that the medical care of your wife was substandard, particularly in so far as despite the highly contagious nature of COVID, patients were inadequately separated from each other in the hospital and old and inadequate ventilators were used to sustain them. In the aftermath of the tragedy, you expressed your anger both in the hospital and outside the hospital at her care and gave a number of XXXX XXXX publicly sharing your opinion of what you believed to be substandard healthcare. Almost immediately, you received attention from police, including while trying to file an official complaint with the judicial system about her treatment, leading you not to go forward. After you triggered an investigation of the system of medical treatment in XXXX by speaking to two (2) journalists, they broadcast television expos\\u00e9s on the health situation in XXXX, which led to public responses from both government \\u2014 health officials and the head of the XXXX province. Around the same time, you fled Iraq in late XXXX 2021 based upon the stress you had already received. You stated that there is nowhere you can go in Iraq to be safe and there is inadequate state protection available to you. You pledge to continue speaking out about the substandard health care in Kurdish Iraq if you return there.\\n[5] On the matter of your identity, your personal identity as a citizen of Iraq has been established by your credible testimony, a copy of your Iraqi passport, which has been entered into evidence, as well as the multiple other documents provide. I find on a balance of probabilities that identity and country of reference have been established.\\n[6] On the matter of nexus, I find there is a nexus between your political opinion, expressing public criticism of healthcare in Kurdish Iraq, and your fear of persecution there. Given this nexus to the ground of political opinion, your claim is being assessed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\\n[7] On the matter of credibility, I find you to be a credible and consistent witness without major discrepancies or contradictions. You described, in compelling detail, your personal situation, the public statements you have made as a result of that situation and how your information to journalists led to Tv expos\\u00e9s on the healthcare system in XXXX. The video evidence provided shows that these expos\\u00e9s were compelling enough to provoke public statements by high-ranking politicians in about late XXXX or early XXXX 2021. I accept as credible that if you return to Iraq you would personally face persecution based upon your past and prospective statements criticizing the nature of, and quality of, healthcare in Iraq. You supported your oral evidence with abundant documentation, including various identity documents, documents confirming your education, your marriage certificates and documents confirming your wife\\u2019s passing. Video footage of your television interviews and statements and transcriptions and translations of the Iraqi tv broadcast. So based upon the evidence provided, I find on a balance of probabilities you have a credible subjective fear of persecution should you return to Iraq.\\n[8] Turning to the objective evidence. The objective evidence from the NDP for Iraq confirms your oral evidence. Item 1.7 of the NDP by the UNDP states that any individual who opposes or is perceived to oppose KRG authorities may be in need of international protection. Freedom House has quoted in Item 4.2 is indicating that, \\u201cPolitical speech in the Kurdistan region can prompt \\u201carbitrary detention or other reprisals from the government or Kurdistan forces.\\u201d\\u201d The government of KRG has stated, in that article, to use the threat of prosecution to intimidate critics. It clearly shows that people who publicly criticized the KRG\\u2019s response to the the pandemic were either arrested or jailed. Both Item 2.9 and the ESO report in 1.11 repeat that in Kurdish Iraq, Kurdish security actors openly target government critics, who face threats of intimidation, physical attacks, arbitrary arrest, politically motivated prosecutions or even civil actions against them. In Item 2.9 the Danish information service quotes one (1) source as saying, \\u201cThe only way one (1) can criticize or stand up to the people in power in KRG is if you are well connected.\\u201d I have no evidence before me to show that you have such an ability or capacity. Accordingly, based upon this objective evidence, I find your fear of persecution in Iraq, based upon your political opinion is well-founded.\\n[9] On the matter of state protection, given the fact that your principal agent of persecution is the government, I am satisfied, on the totality of evidence, that the presumption of state protection is rebutted in this case. Item 4.6 of the NDP at page 4 repeats that the KDP have an iron grip on the region\\u2019s institutions in XXXX and, \\u201cIncluding law enforcement.\\u201d The objective evidence provided by your Counsel shows that despite the rivalry between the ruling parties in northern Iraq, the PUK and KDP will cooperate in efforts to detain and persecute critics in their respective regions. Even if this were not the case, the NDP confirms that access to the rule of law in the Kurdistan region is still dependent on affiliation and connections and it is very difficult for someone like you to individually speak up for their own right. The NDP also indicates that in most cases, if anyone complains about state treatment in Kurdish Iraq, what occurs is a lack of effective investigation prompting a description of the situation as, \\u201cAn atmosphere of impunity.\\u201d So based on all the evidence, I am satisfied that the presumption of state protection is rebutted on a balance of probabilities.\\n[10] On the matter of internal flight alternative, I have also had to consider whether there is somewhere you can go and live in Iraq safely. I am not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that there is one (1) for you. While the NDP does indicate a large Kurdish population near Baghdad, it also indicates that the requirement to speak Arabic to properly resettle in the area is mandatory. Item 1.19 of the NDP at paragraph 534 to 537 says that successful relocation in Iraq will typically depend on the availability of support network in the region, with relocation beyond those networks being a difficult proposition indeed. Your Counsel has provided objective evidence showing that relocation from KDP\\u2019s stronghold of XXXX to PUK held areas is not a viable option for you given the cooperation between these ruling authorities to detain and persecute critics. Because your agents of persecution are government-based actors in Kurdish Iraq, on all the evidence, I am satisfied there is no viable internal flight alternative for you in Iraq.\\n[11] In conclusion, based on all the evidence, I conclude you face a serious possibility of persecution in Iraq connected to your political opinion without adequate state protection or a viable IFA. Therefore, I conclude you are a refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and I accept your claim.\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"other\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 609,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"country\\\": \\\"Syria\\\", \\\"case_type\\\": \\\"Other\\\", \\\"member\\\": \\\"R.

            "[2] In rendering my decision, I considered the Chairperson’s Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. And I note that XXXX was the designated representative for both minors.\n",
            "[3] With respect to your allegations, they are documented in the Basis of Claim form, Item 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. And I’m not going to repeat them in this oral judgement.\n",
            "[4] Just bare-, very briefly, I just want to mention that you fear return to your country because of the domestic abuse that you had suffered at the hands of your former husband. And because of your fear of your uncle, XXXX XXXX XXXX and specifically, his profile and strong beliefs in extreme Islamic views.\n",
            "[5] With respect to your identity, I accept your personal identity as a national of Egypt as well as your children based on certified true copies of your passports.\n",
            "Credibility\n",
            "[6] I found you to be a credible witness who testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner. You, you were asked many questions with respect to your former relationship with your spouse. Sorne of the incidents that had happened in Egypt at the hands of your uncle and your former husband. And with respect to evidence that you provided, including the police report from your father. And the letter of support for your sister. There were no inconsistencies or contradictions.\n",
            "[7] Sorne of the evidence that you provided today are not included in your Basis of Claim form. And you were asked about that and you had explained that you had only received knowledge of those incidents after you had made your refugee claim. I’m not drawing any negative inferences with respect to your omission about the continuing interest from your uncle after your departure to Canada. My understanding from your oral testimony and your written testimony is, is that although you feared both these men in Egypt, it seems that your, that your biggest fear was born out of the threats that you received towards yourself and both your children from your maternal uncle XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n",
            "[8] I, I, I, the objective evidence supports that there are persons that have extreme views in Egypt. Based on your detailed narrative and your oral testimony today, I am, I have no reason to doubt the veracity of your testimony. And I accept that you were a victim, you and your children were both victims of a threat at the hands of your uncle in Egypt. You provided numerous supportive documents in support of your claim that were also consistent. And that includes a report from the Scarborough Hospital that repeats or provides similar information with respect to the harm that you suffered at the hands of your uncle. And it also refers to the abuse that you, the physical and verbal abuse you suffered at the hands of your former husband. This is found in Exhibit 6.\n",
            "[9] With respect to the well-foundedness, the objective basis in Egypt it is well documented that domestic violence including spousal viol-, violence and violence at the hands of family members in Egypt is widespread. This information is also included in the disclosures provided by your counsel that talked about the prevalence of violence against women.\n",
            "[10] Documents show that 30% of Egyptian married women suffer from spousal violence. This is consistent also with the USDOS report found in Item 2.1. It’ s also indicated, this information is echoed in Item 5.5 which is an RI Report in Egypt that talks about the spousal violence in Egypt. I note that according to the Freedom House there’s very few mechanisms that are in place to protect women and offer adequate support. And there’s some restrictions or conditions that require you to bring witnesses or have proof even just for you to have a medical or to, to, to, to go to the police station in Egypt. Which is largely ineffective in terms of the implementation of actually offering protection to women that are similarly situated to you.\n",
            "[11] I’m not going to get into all of the objective evidence but I, I am, I am satisfied that in your personal circumstances, given the profile of specifically your uncle, alone that you would be, that there would be no state protection that would be forthcoming to you. I also do not feel that there would be, you would be safe anywhere else in Egypt given the profile of your uncle. And his motivation to pursue you even after you left Egypt. Based on items found in Exhibit A-, Exhibit 8.\n",
            "[12] So, for all those reasons, I, I am accepting you as a refugee claim. And I find that you ar-, you and your children are, merit to be Convention refugees in Canada. Okay. And I’m accepting your claim.\n",

He alleges that when he returned to Egypt he was arrested and assaulted by members of the police force, who told him that he had to pay them XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds or they would fabricate a file on him which demonstrates that he belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood.\\n[3] The claimant is worried that he will be killed if he returns to Egypt.\\nDETERMINATION\\n[4] I find that the claimant is a protected person pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act.\\nANALYSIS\\nIdentity\\n[5] I find that the identity of the claimant as a national of Egypt has been established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including his passport.2\\nCredibility\\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truth of his allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I have found no reason to doubt the claimant\\u2019s truthfulness with respect to the allegations he has made about being detained and beaten by the police when they attempted to extort him. His testimony on this point was straightforward and consistent with his Basis of Claim form and narrative. I accept these allegations as recounted by the claimant during his testimony as true.\\n[7] I do note that the claimant has provided several documents to corroborate his allegations, including short affidavits written by his mother, his brother, and an individual who says he witnessed the claimant being taken by the Egyptian police to an unknown destination.3 I note that these witness statements are very short, vague, and undated. I therefore attach very little weight to them. The claimant has also provided a police report which indicates only that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019 his brother reported their mother\\u2019s personal supply card had been lost but does not otherwise corroborate his allegation that his mother was beaten and robbed by state authorities who were searching for him.4 Again, I attach little weight to this police report. Despite the low probative value of these corroborating documents, I do not find that they detract from the credibility of the claimant with respect to the allegations he has made about the police beating and trying to extort him.\\n[8] I do have some doubts about the veracity of the claimant\\u2019s allegations with respect to his political opinion, which was raised as an issue by his counsel who asked him a series of leading questions about his political involvement and whether he supports the current regime in Egypt. These allegations contradict many of the statements made in the claimant\\u2019s narrative, in which he stated that he is \\u201cnot a member of the Muslims Brotherhood or any other groups,\\u201d that he has \\u201cnothing to do with politics,\\u201d that he \\u201cpersonally was neither with nor against president Morsi, and never belonged to any political groups,\\u201d and that he is a \\u201cpeaceful person who has never been a member of any political group, and never had any political views.\\u201d Although I do acknowledge that the claimant wrote in his narrative that he has \\u201calways been against injustice, oppression, and poverty\\u201d and that he participated in demonstrations against the regime of Husni Mubarak in 2010, I find that his statements about his political opinion during the hearing directly contradicted many of the statements made in his narrative and that his allegations with respect to being vulnerable to persecution due to his political opinion are not credible.\\nNexus\\n[9] I find that the claimant\\u2019s fear of state authorities in Egypt is not tied to a Convention ground. Rather, the claimant fears state authorities who tried to extort him due to the perception that he is wealthy and lived abroad. As such, I do not find that there is a nexus between the claimant\\u2019s allegations and any of the refugee Convention grounds and I have assessed this claim under section 97(1) of the Act only.\\n[10] Although counsel argued on behalf of the claimant that there is a nexus to political opinion, the claimant clearly stated in the narrative attached to his Basis of Claim form that he \\u201chas never been a member of any political group\\u201d and has \\u201cnever had any political views.\\u201d He also stated that when he was arrested by the police, they told him \\u201cwe know that you have nothing to do with any political parties, and that you are not a member of the group of Muslim Brotherhood, and that you don\\u2019t belong to the Party of Light and justice, like your cousin.\\u201d I thus find that there is insufficient evidence to establish a nexus to political opinion in this case.\\nRisk of Harm\\n[11] To establish his status as a person in need of protection in Egypt, the claimant must show that he would be subjected personally on a balance of probabilities to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, if he returned to Egypt. The claimant has submitted that he is being targeted by state authorities who are trying to extort him.\\n[12] The claimant testified that he moved back to Egypt from Saudi Arabia in XXXX 2018. In approximately XXXX 2018, the claimant visited his cousin, who had been accused of being a member of opposition political parties and who had recently been released after having been detained by state authorities for a year and a half. The claimant was on his way home when he was stopped by police officers who grabbed him and asked him why he had been visiting his cousin. They asked to see his identification and noted that he had managed a restaurant in Saudi Arabia. One of the individuals took a picture of his identification card. The altercation lasted for approximately two hours, following which the claimant was released and told not to visit his cousin again.\\n[13] In approximately XXXX 2018, the claimant testified that he was sitting at home when he was apprehended by individuals in a police patrol car and taken to The Greater Mahalah\\u2019s third police station. He testified that this police station is heavily guarded and has a reputation for being where prisoners are tortured. The claimant testified that he was blindfolded, handcuffed, and made to take off his clothes. He was beaten, insulted, and had cold water thrown over him. At one point, both his feet were tied together and he was hung from the ceiling. Throughout this ordeal, the claimant heard his captors saying \\u201cthis guy is recommended, this is the guy of Saudi Arabia.\\u201d\\n[14] When the claimant was told to put his clothes back on, he was told that because he possessed an iPhone he would be expected to pay. He was transferred to a different room and recognized one of the individuals who had taken a photograph of his identification card in XXXX. He was told: \\u201cwe know that you have nothing to do with any political parties, and that you are not a member of the group of Muslim Brotherhood, and that you don\\u2019t belong to the Party of Light and justice, like your cousin\\u201d but that if he did not pay XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds to the police then they would manufacture a full file about him which indicates that he belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood and he would be punished accordingly. The authorities told the claimant that because he has been living in Saudi Arabia for five years they know he has money.\\n[15] The claimant negotiated with his captors and agreed to pay them XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds. He agreed to provide them with the first XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds the following morning and indicated that he would be able to make another payment in XXXX 2019.\\n[16] The following morning, the claimant transferred the first XXXX XXXX XXXX Egyptian pounds as agreed. He finalized plans to travel to Canada and departed from Egypt on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 prior to the payment of the second installment.\\n[17] The claimant testified that in XXXX 2019, after the second instalment was due, individuals identifying themselves as government officials went to his mother\\u2019s home to ask about his whereabouts. They searched her house, stole her identification documents and valuables, and hit her on the head. The claimant explained that his brother took their mother to the police station to report the incident and was told that if he proceeded further with the claim they would \\u201ceradicate\\u201d him from \\u201cthe face of the earth.\\u201d\\n[18] The claimant testified that following this incident he has minimized contact with his mother, so as not to endanger her. He worries that phone calls are being monitored. He has asked his mother indirectly if any individuals are still looking for him and believes that they are.\\n[19] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimant\\u2019s allegations and indicates that incidents of arbitrary arrest and detention are \\u201cfrequent.\\u201d In 2018, local activists and rights groups have stated that \\u201chundreds\\u201d of arrests did not comply with due process laws. A report issued on December 10, 2018 by the Arabic Network for Human Right Information indicates that the police have gone so far as to refuse to release defendants that the court has ordered must be released. There is also evidence that civilians may be beaten and/or tortured while in detention, as well as reports of suspects being killed in unclear circumstances following their arrest. In 2018, for example, press reports indicated that Abdel Halim Mohamed El-Nahas died following a five-hour interrogation in Tora Prison. In June of that same year, authorities killed 10 persons and arrested two in raids conducted across the country, alleging that those who were killed or arrested were involved in an opposition movement.5 The Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) has identified 30 people who died from torture while being held in police stations and other Interior Ministry detention sites between August 2013 and December 2015. In 2016, the ECRF reported that its lawyers received 830 torture complaints and that a further 14 people had died from torture in custody.6\\n[20] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, including the claimant\\u2019s testimony and the objective evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would face a forward-facing risk to his life from state authorities in Egypt. The principal claimant was detained and beaten on two occasions by state authorities who were seeking to extort him. He has now left the country with an outstanding debt to these officers. These state authorities continued to target the claimant\\u2019s mother after he left the country.\\n[21] The next question for me to consider under a section 97 claim is whether, in the context of the allegations, the claimant has provided sufficient evidence of his specific circumstances to establish that his risk is distinct from that of the general population.\\n[22] Pursuant to section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Act, claimants are not entitled to protection under the Act if the risk they face to their lives of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, in Egypt, is a risk that is generally faced by others in or from Egypt. The claimant must establish that he would face a risk different from those risks faced by the general population there.\\n[23] Consideration of a claim under section 97(1)(b) requires an individualized inquiry on the evidence, in the context of a present or perspective risk for the claimant, to determine if the risk personally faced by the claimant is also faced by others, generally, in Egypt. In this case, the claimant has been targeted, threatened, and subjected to violence by state authorities. This escalated from an encounter on the street, to the claimant\\u2019s arrest, and finally to physical assault. This is a specific and personalized risk. I find that these circumstances change the nature of the claimant\\u2019s risk to a non-generalized risk that is particular to this particular claimant. In my view, the claimant has established the objective basis of his claims, and has also established that the risk he faces is one that he personally faces and that is not faced generally by the population of Egypt.\\nState Protection\\n[24] Given that the state is the agent of harm in this case, I find that the state would not be willing or able to provide protection to the claimant. I find that the state agents who targeted the claimant are not merely rogue officers. The objective evidence indicates that Egyptian state authorities engage in widespread arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, and torture against perceived dissidents and that the way they treated the claimant is part of a larger pattern of abuse perpetrated against civilians.7\\n[25] I find that the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\\n[26] The test for a viable Internal Flight Alternative is two pronged. The Board must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted, or on a balance of probabilities subjected personally to a section 97(1) risk of harm in the IFA location, and conditions there must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.\\n[27] In this case, I find that the state authorities who have demonstrated an interest in the claimant would likely be able to find the claimant anywhere in the country. The evidence in this case indicates that state authorities continue to be motivated to locate the claimant, as they tracked him down, arrested, and beat him while he was in Egypt, and continue to attempt to search for him at his mother\\u2019s house now that he has left the country.\\n[28] I find that state authorities were initially motivated to look for the claimant due to the perception that he has financial resources because he spent a significant amount of time out of the country, and that he became a target once he was drawn to their attention following his visit to his cousin\\u2019s house. I further find that following the claimant\\u2019s disappearance from Egypt this motivation would have increased due to the perception that he did not abide by the \\u201cdeal\\u201d he made with authorities when he was detained.\\n[29] State authorities would certainly have the means to locate the claimant throughout the country, as the government maintains effective control across Egypt.\\n[30] As such, I find on a balance of probabilities that it is more likely than not that the claimant would face a risk to his life throughout the country. In my view, there is no viable IFA available to the claimant.\\nCONCLUSION\\n[31] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant is a person in need of protection in Egypt under section 97 of the Act and accept his claim.\\n(signed) Megan Kammerer\\nMarch 20, 2020\\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\\n2 Exhibit 1.\\n3 Exhibit 4.\\n4 Exhibit 5.\\n5 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Egypt, September 30, 2019, Item 2.1.\\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 10.1.\\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 10.1.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"other\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{\\\"country\\\": \\\"Egypt\\\", \\\"case_type\\\": \\\"No Nexus: Criminality/Corruption\\\", \\\"member\\\": \\\"Megan Kammerer\\\"}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_trans\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"True\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "MEMBER:\n",
            "[1] I’ve reviewed the documents in this claim and asked the claimant some questions. I’m prepared to give my decision now.\n",
            "[2] The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX is making a claim against Colombia, seeking refugee protection pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n",
            "[3] I find you are a convention refugee for the following reasons.\n",
            "[4] The allegations are set out in the claimant’s basis of claim form. They’re quite detailed and consistent throughout the narrative. They do not raise any credibility concerns that need to be addressed on what I considered to be the key issue here.\n",
            "[5] The allegations, as I see it, are on two parts. The first part is regarding gender identity. The second is regarding possible criminal targeting.\n",
            "[6] Based on the documents I’ve been supplied in, in support of the claim, I accept as credible the allegations regarding gender identity. This is, this is the (indiscernible) of the claim, this is sufficient for me to make a positive decision on.\n",
            "[7] So, I’ve not addressed the possible criminal targeting by paramilitaries because it is not necessary, and I, I make no finding on that aspect of the claim. As I said, it’s not necessary for me to, to.\n",
            "[8] The claimant’ s described his understanding of his, of his gender identity experiences. He lived as a result of that identity, and these are consistent with — as I said, internally consistent and consistent with country condition documents on Colombia. I have no reason to, to — I have no credibility concerns about, about those allegations.\n",
            "[9] The claimant submitted a passport. The passport is in the — includes the claimant’s (indiscernible) a former middle name. But I, I acknowledge that it is a passport issued to the claimant, and therefore it is sufficient to establish his identity and his, his Colombian nationality.\n",
            "[10] With regard to level of risk, this is covered in part by the claimant’s own evidence and by the, the country documents. I’m just going to refer briefly to a couple of documents that were submitted by counsel.\n",
            "[11] The first was an article contained in the 2019 package. It has one statement in particular that, that I find summarizes what, what I understand to be the situation in Colombia for the claimant and others generally situated. And it’s page 54, 55 of the country — first country condition document that speaks about the paradox between laws and practice.\n",
            "[12] The, the quote is that there is a strong — I’m going to be paraphrasing a little bit — there’s a strong legal framework, but in practice, practice it is rarely enforced. And that is my understanding from reviewing the country documents generally on, on this, this issue.\n",
            "[13] Other documents were included with the next country condition — the next package, which included country condition documents. These were all consistent and they point to, I think, persuasive evidence that you would be facing more than a mere possibility– a reasonable chance — there’s difference ways it’s phrased in the, in the, the, the jurisprudence. You would face a reasonable chance of persecution due to your gender identity.\n",
            "[14] Since gender identity is concluded in the Canadian law as coming within the parameters of the convention refugee decision — the — convention refugee definition as being a member of a particular social group.\n",
            "[15] The country documents also point to two other issues I have to address. And the first is state protection. Again, both your evidence, your statements and your narrative speak of your experiences trying to access state protection in Colombia, and the documents are consistent with that.\n",
            "[16] And, and, and I point out that your experience is part of a, a broader, a broader issue in the country. What you experienced is consistent with what happens in Colombia far too regularly, such that I would have to say that for you, there is not on, on a balance of probabilities state protection in Colombia at this time.\n",
            "[17] The laws that have been passed may eventually result in practices which could in the future mean that you would have state protection in Colombia, but I’m assessing the claim as things are now. So, as things are now, I do not find that you would have, have state protection in Colombia; would be afforded state protection in Colombia.\n",
            "[18] With regard to internal flight alternative, the problem for — that goes to, to a lack of state protection is cultural attitudes. And I, I do not see any evidence before me that there are places in Colombia you would live where the cultural attitudes would be different from what you’ve experienced or what the documents speak of. So, therefore I do not find that there is a reasonable internal flight alternative available to you in Colombia.\n",
            "[19] So, based on the reasons just given and on review of the evidence, I find you’re a convention refugee and I accept your claim.\n",

            "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
            "INTRODUCTION\n",
            "[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, legally known as XXXX XXXX, who alleges that they are a citizen of Ukraine, and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the “IRPA“).\n",
            "[2] This claim has been decided without a hearing, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board’s Chairperson’s Instructions Governing the Streaming of Less Complex Claims at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and paragraph 170(f) of the IRPA.\n",
            "ALLEGATIONS\n",
            "[3] The details of the claimant’ s allegations are fully set out in their Basis of Claim form and narrative, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2019.1 To summarize, the claimant alleges that they fear persecution at the hands of the Ukrainian police and Ukrainian society, including far-right nationalist groups, due to their sexual orientation and gender identity as a bisexual, non-binary, transgender person.\n",
            "DETERMINATION\n",
            "[4] For the following reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, because they face a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine.\n",
            "ANALYSIS\n",
            "Identity\n",
            "[5] The panel finds that the claimant’s identity as a Ukrainian citizen is established, on a balance of probabilities, by a certified copy of their genuine Ukrainian passport.2\n",
            "Nexus\n",
            "[6] The panel finds that there is a link between the claimant’s fear and the Convention refugee definition – namely, membership in a particular social group as a queer, non-binary, transgender person. Accordingly, the panel has assessed their claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA.\n",
            "Credibility\n",
            "[7] The claimant’s narrative includes a detailed description of growing up in a repressive and abusive environment, where they were abused by their parents, bullied, and physically and sexually assaulted, including by their classmates, for not conforming to gender norms. The claimant also gives a detailed description of how they came to understand their own sexual orientation and gender identity after coming to Canada. The claimant’s BOC form and narrative are internally consistent, and entirely consistent with the other forms they completed upon initiating their refugee claim.\n",
            "[8] The claimant submitted relevant and probative documentary evidence corroborating their allegations.3 That evidence includes a copy of their birth certificate; copies of detailed social media posts expressing their sexual orientation and gender identity; detailed letters of support, including from the claimant’s partners and other friends described in their narrative; documents showing that the claimant attended the 519 “Among Friends” program well before initiating a refugee claim; photos of the claimant with partners and friends, including at Pride events; and a letter from the claimant’s XXXX corroborating their XXXX health issues.\n",
            "[9] The claimant’s documentary evidence is consistent, in content and chronology, with their basis of claim form and narrative and with the other evidence in their claim.\n",
            "[10] The panel believes what the claimant has alleged and finds that they have established on a balance of probabilities that they are a queer, non-binary, transgender person.\n",
            "Subjective Fear\n",
            "[11] The panel notes that the claimant arrived in Canada in 2013 but did not file a refugee claim until XXXX 2019, at which point they had been out of status since XXXX 2017.4 The panel considered whether this gives rise to a negative inference as to their subjective fear of returning to Ukraine.\n",
            "[12] The claimant explained that prior to leaving Ukraine to attend university in Toronto in 2013, they were unaware of their sexual orientation and gender identity. It was only after becoming part of a community of transgender, non-binary and other queer persons that they began to explore this aspect of their identity. They began to identify as, and publicly came out as, a non-binary transgender person in XXXX 2016, at which point they changed their chosen name from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant has not returned to Ukraine since that time.\n",
            "[13] The claimant also explained that although they learned of the existence of the refugee claim system in XXXX 2017 after visiting the 519, their poor XXXX health and homelessness made it difficult to make decisions and seek information about anything outside day-to-day survival.\n",
            "[14] The claimant explained that in XXXX 2018, they were finally able to access healthcare for the first time since the expiry of their previous health insurance, and that after receiving XXXX health treatment they began working with a lawyer to prepare a refugee claim in XXXX 2018. However, after an exploitative employment situation, followed by the loss of their job, their XXXX health again worsened, and they were unable to continue. The claimant alleged that it was only after their partner reached out to their current counsel in XXXX 2018, and learned of the existence of legal aid, that the claimant felt able to continue working on their claim.\n",
            "[15] The claimant submitted evidence corroborating that they had begun working with a lawyer in XXXX 2018,5 as well as evidence corroborating their XXXX health challenges.6\n",
            "[16] The panel finds that the claimant has provided a reasonable explanation of how their poverty, homelessness and XXXX health issues led to their delay in filing a refugee claim. Accordingly, the panel does not draw a negative credibility inference, and finds that the claimant has established that they fear returning to Ukraine.\n",
            "Objective basis\n",
            "[17] The panel finds that the claimant’s fear of persecution in Ukraine as a queer, non-binary, transgender person is objectively well founded, and that going forward the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution. In reaching this conclusion, the panel considered the documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Ukraine dated June 30, 2020,7 as well as the country condition evidence submitted by counsel.8\n",
            "[18] Despite the fact that consensual same sex activity was decriminalised in Ukraine in 1991, the objective evidence suggests that “LGBTI people are by and large forced to hide their identities as a result of stigma”.9\n",
            "[19] Transgender persons additionally face unique challenges. They reported “difficulties obtaining official documents reflecting their gender identity, which resulted in discrimination in health care, education, and other areas.”10\n",
            "[20] There have been some minor improvements in state policy towards transgender persons. For instance, transgender individuals are no longer required to “undergo sex reassignment surgery to change their names and genders officially”. However, they are still required to receive “counseling and hormone therapy” to do so. Moreover, regulations “still prevent reassignment for married individuals and those with minor children.” Furthermore, “transsexuality” is still classified as a psychiatric disorder, and those individuals who do wish to have reassignment surgery “must spend 30 days in a psychiatric hospital amongst the mentally ill before this is considered”.11 A person with a diagnosis of “transsexualism” is “legally prohibited to be a guardian of a child.”12 Until very recently, forced sterilization was required as a part of the legal procedure for gender recognition.13\n",
            "[21] Societal violence against LGBTI persons in Ukraine continues to be prevalent and was “often perpetrated by members of violent radical groups.”14 Authorities reportedly “often did not adequately investigate these cases or hold perpetrators to account.”15 Attacks against members of the LGBTI community “were rarely classified under criminal provisions pertaining to hate crimes, which carried heavier penalties.”16 Moreover, such crimes and discrimination are considered underreported.17\n",
            "[22] Far-right nationalists and other radical groups “consistently tried to disrupt LGBTI events with violence or threats of violence.”18 For instance, at a “Trans March” held on Transgender Day of Remembrance in Kyiv, the eighty people marching were attacked by extremists from the “Tradition and Order” far-right group. While six attackers were detained by the police, they were only charged with “petty hooliganism”.19 Similarly, police intervened and detained members of the radical groups who attacked participants at the European Lesbian Conference in Kyiv with tear gas. However, the “attackers were subsequently released, and no charges were filed.”20\n",
            "[23] In summary, the panel finds that the objective evidence strongly corroborates that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.\n",
            "State Protection\n",
            "[24] There is a presumption that States are capable of protecting their own citizens. However, a claimant can rebut the presumption of State protection, and demonstrate that such protection would not be provided, with clear and convincing evidence of the unwillingness or inability of the State to protect them.21\n",
            "[25] The objective evidence described above details the inadequate response by police to violence and other abusive behaviour against the LGBTI community. A 2020 report from the “LGBT Human Rights Nash Mir Center” summed up the situation as such: “Hate crimes against LGBT people are investigated ineffectively, offenders often avoid responsibility, and the motives of intolerance on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity are ignored.”22\n",
            "[26] In addition to the incidents and patterns already described, there are also reports of police violence against members of the LGBTI community, and instances of the police luring members of the community through online ads and then extorting them for money.23 Moreover, police reportedly “used laws on human trafficking or prostitution as a pretext to target LGBTI persons”, including in a raid on a gay nightclub in Dnipro in April 2018.\n",
            "[27] With respect to police protection for Pride and other marches, a report by Freedom House states that “when police do provide protection, they often only protect the assembly itself, allowing participants to be attacked before and after the event.”24\n",
            "[28] Having considered all the evidence, the panel finds that the presumption of State protection has been rebutted.\n",
            "Internal flight alternative\n",
            "[29] The panel considered whether a viable internal flight alternative exists for the claimant. Given the objective evidence already cited above, which confirms that the State and its agents are often among the agents of persecution, whether directly or indirectly, the panel finds that the claimant does not have an internal flight alternative. There is nowhere in Ukraine that they could safely live openly as a queer, non-binary, transgender person.\n",
            "CONCLUSION\n",
            "[30] Having considered all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, as they face a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine on the basis of their sexual orientation and their gender identity and expression. Their claim is therefore accepted.\n",
